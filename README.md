RORegEx
=============

An Objective-C library that implements simple fast (polynomial instead of exponential scaling) regular expression pattern matching using a nondeterministic finite automaton.

- Supports several matches in a single string; returns results as an NSTextMatchingResult object.
- Currently provides greedy but minimal matching; returns the earliest and smallest match to the pattern.
- Currently only implements parentheses, ., *, | and ? operators.

## Installation

Including NSString+RORegEx.h in your project allows sending a match:(NSString*) regEx command directly to an NSString object. The full XCode project is available for running all implemented tests.
